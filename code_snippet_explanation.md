### Level 1:
This code is a part of a web application that deals with departments and employees. It defines two methods: `get_all_emps_departwise` and `get_all_emps_departwise_async`.

The `get_all_emps_departwise` method returns a list of all departments ordered by their title. It uses the `Department` model to fetch all department objects from the database and orders them based on their title.

The `get_all_emps_departwise_async` method also returns a list of all departments ordered by their title, but it does so asynchronously. This means that it can perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving the overall performance of the application. It uses the `sync_to_async` function to convert the synchronous operation of fetching department objects into an asynchronous operation.

### Level 2:
In this code, we have two methods `get_all_emps_departwise` and `get_all_emps_departwise_async` that are part of an API. These methods handle the request to retrieve all departments ordered by their title.

The `get_all_emps_departwise` method is a synchronous method that fetches all department objects from the database using the `Department.objects.all()` queryset. It then orders the departments by their title using the `order_by` method. Finally, it returns the list of departments.

The `get_all_emps_departwise_async` method is an asynchronous method that performs the same operation as `get_all_emps_departwise`, but in an asynchronous manner. It uses the `sync_to_async` function from the `asgiref` library to convert the synchronous operation of fetching department objects into an asynchronous operation. This allows the method to perform other tasks concurrently while waiting for the database query to complete. Once the departments are fetched, the method returns the list of departments.

### Level 3:
```python
@api_v1.get("/departments", response=List[DeptOut])
def get_all_emps_departwise(request):
    depts = Department.objects.all().order_by("title")
    return depts
```
The `get_all_emps_departwise` method is a synchronous method that handles the GET request to retrieve all departments. It uses the `Department.objects.all()` queryset to fetch all department objects from the database. The `order_by("title")` method is used to order the departments by their title. Finally, it returns the list of departments.

```python
@api_v2.get("/departments", response=List[DeptOut])
async def get_all_emps_departwise_async(request):
    depts = Department.objects.all().order_by("title")
    await sync_to_async(list)(depts)
    return depts
```
The `get_all_emps_departwise_async` method is an asynchronous method that handles the GET request to retrieve all departments. It uses the `Department.objects.all()` queryset to fetch all department objects from the database. The `order_by("title")` method is used to order the departments by their title. The `sync_to_async` function is used to convert the synchronous operation of fetching department objects into an asynchronous operation. This allows the method to perform other tasks concurrently while waiting for the database query to complete. Finally, it returns the list of departments.
